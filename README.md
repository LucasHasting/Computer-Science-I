## C++-Installation

The programs in this repository can be executed using the [C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) language and the g++ compiler.

### Option 1: using [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/LucasHasting/Programming-Languages-Research-Paper.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```sh
    cd Programming-Languages-Research-Paper/Programs
    ```
    
### Option 2: without git
1. Download the project as a zip file
2. [Extract the zip file](https://www.wikihow.com/Unzip-a-File)

#### Run from the command line
1. Find the location of the files
2. Copy the path
3. go to the command line and run the following:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/files
   ```

### Compile and Execute
Compile the program:
```sh
rustc program-name
```

Executing the program in Windows:
```sh
program-name.exe
```

Executing the program in Linux/Mac:
```sh
./program-name
```

## Important-Notice
Programs 18-27 are for demonstration purposes on what Rust can and can not do safely, the programs may not run or may crash and are designed that way.
