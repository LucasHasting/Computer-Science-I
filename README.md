# Computer Science I
This repository holds all programs made in my Computer Science I class. Any program not included in the individual program folder contains an input file used in the program. Each file contains a description of what the program does.

# C++ Installation and Usage

The programs in this repository can be executed using the C++ language and the g++ compiler.

g++ for [Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/), don't forget to add the binary to the [path environment variable](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

g++ can be installed on Linux using your favorite package manager.

Next, download the repo by downloading the [ZIP](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github) or by using [git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git).
